# DImage
DImage is Simple proof of concept of image viewer with possibility to open multiple images at once, and have them all listed on left side. There is also possibility to do some changes to image that using basic OpenCV algorithms. They will come some updates to this in the future. For now its my repository to learn QT and OpenCV with C++ language
